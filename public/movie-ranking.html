<p>Ever since childhood, i've always loved this movie, it is the only movie I could ever relate my mind to. The endless theories about Coraline and her life, questions, questions and more questions! It will forever be my #1 movie.</p>

<h3>2. Corpse Bride</h3>

<p>This movie has had me on a chokehold ever since I first watched it. I still don't know why, maybe the overall eerie vibe of it, or maybe the sadness, darkness and hopelessness that revolves around the movie itself. Not just that, but Emily, the literal corpse bride, is my one of my favorite movie characters.   </p>

<h3>3. Hidden Figures</h3>

<p>I can never remember the name of this movie but I know exactly what I mean when I say the movie about "the first black woman mathematician who worked at NASA". Now this movie is amazing, Taraji P. Henson being my favorite actress and the fact that it's based on a true story is the cherry on top. By far my favorite non fiction, non animated movie of all time. </p>
